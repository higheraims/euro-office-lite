# Euro-Office Lite

Lightweight desktop office suite built on Tauri v2 and Euro-Office editors. Installers: ~89 MB (Windows), ~113-120 MB (macOS), ~121 MB (Linux .deb), ~82 MB (Flatpak). No cloud, no telemetry.

Supports Word, Excel, and PowerPoint documents with native file operations and direct printing. Available for Windows (x64, ARM64), macOS (Apple Silicon and Intel, signed and notarized), and Linux (x64 .deb and Flatpak).

> **Alpha**: This project is in early development. Core features work (create, open, edit, save), but expect rough edges. Printing works on Windows; PDF export works on all platforms.

## Known issues

Euro-Office Lite is alpha. A few things you will run into early:

- **Only English and Spanish are checked out of the box** (#6). Dictionaries for both ship with the app (every regional Spanish variant is checked). Text in other languages is left unchecked, not marked as wrong, and you can add any other language yourself: see [Adding more spellcheck languages](#adding-more-spellcheck-languages).
- **No crash recovery.** Closing the window prompts you to save unsaved changes, but if the app crashes or is force-quit mid-edit, that unsaved work is lost. Save often.
- **Plain text (.txt) and .csv files cannot be opened yet.** They need an encoding and delimiter dialog the app does not have; DOCX, XLSX, PPTX, ODT, ODS, ODP and RTF all work.

## Requirements

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) 18+
- [Rust](https://rustup.rs/) 1.77+
- Visual Studio 2022 with C++ desktop workload (for native compilation)

## Getting started

```powershell
git clone --recursive https://github.com/delmarguillen/euro-office-lite.git
cd euro-office-lite
npm install
.\scripts\setup.ps1       # generates sdkjs develop scripts and fonts
.\scripts\get-x2t.ps1     # downloads x2t converter binaries (requires admin)
npx tauri dev
```

`setup.ps1` runs `grunt develop` inside sdkjs to generate the JS module loaders (`scripts.js`) that each editor needs at runtime. Run it again after updating the sdkjs submodule.

`get-x2t.ps1` downloads the x2t converter binaries (~60 MB) from the repo's `dependencies` release into `src-tauri/binaries/`. Requires [GitHub CLI](https://cli.github.com/) (`gh`) authenticated.

## Build installer

```powershell
.\scripts\prepare-dist.ps1    # stages slim frontend into src-dist/
npx tauri build
```

Output goes to `src-tauri/target/release/bundle/nsis/`.

## Architecture

```
User <-> Tauri WebView2 <-> sdkjs/web-apps (editor UI)
                        <-> bridge.js (desktop bridge shim)
                        <-> Rust backend <-> x2t (format conversion)
                                         <-> tauri-plugin-printer-v2 (native printing)
```

- **sdkjs / web-apps**: Editor frontend (submodules, do not modify)
- **bridge.js**: Implements the `AscDesktopEditor` API that sdkjs expects from a desktop host
- **x2t**: Converts between DOCX/XLSX/PPTX and Editor.bin (sdkjs internal format)
- **Printing**: Generates PDF via x2t + DoctRenderer. On Windows, sends to printer via bundled SumatraPDF. On Linux, opens PDF with the system viewer via xdg-open

## CI/CD

Pushing a tag `v*` triggers the GitHub Actions workflow which builds Windows (x64, ARM64), macOS (Apple Silicon and Intel, signed and notarized), and Linux (x64) installers and creates a GitHub Release. Tags containing `alpha`, `beta`, or `rc` are marked as pre-release.

## Installing on macOS

DMG builds are signed and notarized by Apple: download, open the DMG, drag to Applications and double-click. No Gatekeeper workarounds needed. Requires macOS 12 (Monterey) or later. Since v0.16.0-alpha, DMGs are available for both Apple Silicon (`aarch64`) and Intel (`x86_64`) Macs; download the one matching your machine.

## Installing on Linux

Install the `.deb` with `apt` so dependencies are resolved automatically:

```bash
sudo apt install ./Euro-Office-Lite_<version>_amd64.deb
```

Do **not** use `dpkg -i` directly, since it will not install the required `libwebkit2gtk-4.1-0` dependency.

For Fedora, Arch, immutable distros, or any Linux with Flatpak:

```bash
# Add repository (one-time)
flatpak remote-add --user --if-not-exists --no-gpg-verify euro-office \
  https://delmarguillen.github.io/euro-office-lite/repo

# Install
flatpak install --user euro-office org.eurooffice.Lite

# Update (future releases)
flatpak update org.eurooffice.Lite
```

Or download the `.flatpak` bundle from the release assets.

## Adding more spellcheck languages

English and Spanish ship with the app. Any other language from the [Euro-Office dictionaries repository](https://github.com/Euro-Office/dictionaries) can be added by copying its folder into your own dictionaries folder and restarting the app.

- **Windows**: `%APPDATA%\org.euro-office.lite\dictionaries\`
- **macOS**: `~/Library/Application Support/org.euro-office.lite/dictionaries/`
- **Linux**: `~/.local/share/org.euro-office.lite/dictionaries/`

Create the folder if it is not there yet. Each language goes in its own folder holding the two files hunspell needs, named after the folder, so Ukrainian is `uk_UA/uk_UA.aff` and `uk_UA/uk_UA.dic`. Keep the folder name the repository gives it, because that name is how the app matches your folder to the language set on the text. A folder missing either file is ignored, and the reason is written to the log file listed below.

The app downloads nothing. You fetch the dictionary with your browser and copy it in yourself.

## Log files

- **Windows**: `%TEMP%\euro-office-lite\js-debug.log`
- **macOS / Linux**: `/tmp/euro-office-lite/js-debug.log`

## Credits and attribution

Euro-Office Lite is a lightweight desktop shell around the document editors of the [Euro-Office](https://github.com/Euro-Office) project, an independent community fork of the editors originally developed by ONLYOFFICE (Ascensio System SIA). The editing engine ([sdkjs](https://github.com/Euro-Office/sdkjs)) and UI ([web-apps](https://github.com/Euro-Office/web-apps)) are included as unmodified submodules under AGPL-3.0. The x2t document converter binaries are currently taken unmodified from [ONLYOFFICE Desktop Editors](https://github.com/ONLYOFFICE/DesktopEditors) releases; their corresponding source is available at [ONLYOFFICE/core](https://github.com/ONLYOFFICE/core) under the matching version tags (AGPL-3.0). All credit for the editing engine belongs to their respective developers.

What this project adds on top: the Tauri v2 native shell and desktop bridge, macOS support with signed and notarized builds, packaging for Windows (NSIS), Linux (.deb and Flatpak with a self-hosted repo), fully offline operation with no cloud, no accounts and no telemetry, and native file operations, printing and PDF export.
